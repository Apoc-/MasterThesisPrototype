We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

<b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools
<b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation
<b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation
<b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
